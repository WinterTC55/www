This community group aims to provide a space for JS runtimes to collaborate on
API interoperability. We focus on documenting and improving interoperability of
web platform APIs across runtimes (especially non-Browser ones). This is done
through discussions between runtimes, proposals for new and existing web APIs in
existing specification venues (WHATWG, W3C), and documentation of existing
runtime behaviours.
